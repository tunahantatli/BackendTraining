"""
example:
studentSchoolNumber = "362" -> this wrong
studentSnumber = "362" -> this wrong
student_num = "362" -> this is correct
school_num = "362" -> this is correct
  variables name should be lowercase, short, understandable
  if variables name consists of more than one word, should use underdash
  !!! important 1(one) l(L) O(o uppercase letter) should'nt use :)
